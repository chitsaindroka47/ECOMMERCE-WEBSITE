-**React To-Do List App**
Hey there! This is a simple and colorful To-Do List app built with React. It helps you keep track of your tasks easily with a nice gradient background to brighten up your day.

-**What it does**

* Add tasks quickly — no empty tasks allowed!
* Mark tasks as done or undo them with a click.
* Delete tasks you’ve finished or don’t want anymore.
* Filter your list to see all tasks, just the active ones, or only the completed ones.
* Sort tasks alphabetically whenever you want.
* Your tasks are saved right in your browser, so they’ll still be there even if you refresh or close the page.
* Looks good too, thanks to a smooth colorful gradient background!

-**How to get it running**

1. Clone the repo to your computer:
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`

2. Go inside the folder:
   `cd your-repo`

3. Install all the needed packages:
   `npm install`

4. Start the app locally:
   `npm start`

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your To-Do List!

-**How to use it**

* Type in your task and hit the **Add** button.
* Click **Complete** next to a task to mark it done or undo it if you change your mind.
* Click **Delete** to remove tasks you no longer want to see.
* Use the filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) to organize your view.
* Want to sort tasks? Just hit the **Sort** button!
* Close your browser or refresh — your list will stay safe thanks to localStorage.

-**What’s inside?**

* React components that make it all happen.
* CSS with a beautiful gradient background.
* localStorage to keep your tasks saved.

-**Tech stack**

* JavaScript
* CSS (with gradient magic)
